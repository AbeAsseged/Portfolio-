    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am recent graduate from Per Scholas' rigorous software engineering       
        bootcamp certificate program, specializing in MERN Stack software development. My journey has been driven by a passion for continuous learning and a strong foundation in software engineering principles.
        
        Through intensive hands-on projects and valuable collaboration with peers, I've honed exceptional problem-solving skills and gained practical experience with various programming languages and frameworks like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Drawing from my background in organized team sports, I thrive in team settings and value collaboration as a means to innovate and grow.
       
        I'm eagerly looking forward to applying my knowledge, skills, and the love for continuous learning in the dynamic field of full-stack development. Let's work together to create remarkable solutions and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology.</p>

        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>Player v Computer

            What's the Game? Where you try to answer a countries name just based off of the map of the country along with the flag, its an open ended question no multipule choices, hence making the game a bit difficult. The way the game works is when the player clicks on the map of the country with the falg on the map, a fill in the black appears on the top of the page if question is answered correctly the player will be notified if not also the player will be notified that the answer was incorrect.</p>
